			<h2>
				Hi, I'm Mitch!
			</h2>
			<p>
				This is my first year at UTS, well first year at University, and I'm studying the <a href ="https://www.uts.edu.au/future-students/find-a-course/courses/c10143" target="_blank">Bachelor of Information Technology.</a>  Last year (2017) I graduated from my high school, Newington College, which is located in Sydney's Innerwest. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I didn't study any computing subjects during high school, yet my love for IT was alway a hobby. Later in my time at high school year I found a part time job doing some infastructure, networking and device management work.
			</p>
			<p>
				My course will take me 3 years to complete and I hope that after graduation I will take a couple years to get some more industry experiece, or even a graduate position on the other side of the globe, before coming back to my home country and settle down with a full time job.
			</p>
			<h3>
				My Hobbies are:
			</h3>
			<ul>
					<li>Driving with friends (nasho!) - yes some people consider us <span class="italics">"rev-heads"</span>.</li>
					<li>Working - the quote "choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life." is right.</li>
					<li>Rugby Union - I have played this game since I could stand on two legs, yet only stopped this year cause I'd prefer to not have a 150kg 30 year old swashing every bone in my body.</li>
					<li>
						Watching the greatest TV shows of all time:
						<ol>
							<li>Suites</li>
							<li>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</li>
							<li>The Office (US version)</li> 
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ul>
