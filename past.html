				My time at school, wasn't a place where I expanded my ICT knowledge. I was stupid in selecting my HSC subjects, as even though I had a strong passion for IT and some development work I didn't pick IPT or Software. Even though I kick myself for not doing these subject I was able to utilise my skills for Design and Technology where for my major work I did some work with arduinos (which uses a lightweight version C/C++), playing around with I/O with sensors, lights, and speakers. I have also had a lot of experience with the Adobe Suite with a particular focus in Photoshop, Lightroom, Premier Pro and After Effects because of my interest in Digital Media Artwork.

				Work Experience
			</h3>
			<p> IT related places I've worked: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Newington College ICT Dept (2015-2017)</li>
				<li>Wenona School ICT Dept (2017-Present)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				As you can see from above over the past 3 to 4 years I have had a decent amount of IT experience. With my interest in IT, I had done some work with my school IT department. I worked closely with the Senior Infrastructure Manager where he took me on under his team in an intern-like role where I was doing small dinky work (installing and seting up server, yet moved through the ranks and started doing some minimal server management and system administrator. I worked as a lead for the year device rollout where I managed casuals. I then took a break during the school year of 2017 to study for my HSC. I then after HSC started my job at Wenona School, where I was a primary ICT Technician, yet lead device management and was escalation point for any and all macOS and iPad issues. I set up a macOS server and networked apple tvs for classrooms. I have completed the AWS Technicals Essentials Course and have extensively self taught JAMF PRO (JSS Server) as well as Apple Script, Bash (Shell) Scripting and PowerShell.
