			<p>The main idea behind this website is a very simple navigating website with clean aesthetics. I started doing some research on website out there and found some nice concepts for a navigational bar and header with a very faint background image. I also wanted to use a photo that I had taken my self as a background which is very soft because of its transparency. And obviously wanted the content to pop, as for the jet black boarder and snow white background. Scalability was an important factor for me, the ability for the website to be viewed on any device, from TV to a smart phone, and still look beautiful. The website used a simple main structure which allowed me to create skeleton to ensure all pages use the same styling classes, making it easier for myself when it comes to debugging time. </p>
			<h3>Structural Layout</h3>
			<p>The structure for my website is as shown below.</p>

			<h3>Aesthetics ~ Colours</h3>
			<p>A website that you would like to be soft to the eyes requires colours that are compatible with each other. '<a href ="https://www.uts.edu.au/future-students/find-a-course/courses/c10143" target="_blank" >cooler.co</a>' is a really good website which can generate a really nice colour palette. Knew I wanted blue in my website so I found a blue I loved (B'DAZZLED BLUE) and then generate a palette around that colour, found the orange, locked that in and generated around the now saved colours. I repeated this to get the red. You can see these colours used for body text, backgrounds, headings and the navigational bar at the top of the website. I also used Helvetics for the body (paragraph) text due to the lightweight feel and how easy on the eyes it is.</p>
